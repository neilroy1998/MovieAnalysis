1
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:08,500
SUNSHINE THROUGH THE RAIN

2
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,344
You're staying home.

3
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:49,917
The sun is shining, but it's raining.

4
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:53,012
Foxes hoId their wedding
processions in this weather.

5
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:56,387
And they don't Iike
anyone to see them.

6
00:02:57,327 --> 00:02:59,659
If you do,
they'II be very angry.

7
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,899
You went and saw...

8
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:20,107
... something you shouIdn't have.

9
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:24,011
I can't Iet you in now.

10
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,417
An angry fox came Iooking for you.

11
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,954
He Ieft this.

12
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,074
You're supposed to kiII yourseIf.

13
00:09:56,612 --> 00:10:00,708
Go quickIy and ask
their forgiveness.

14
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:06,850
Give the knife back and teII them
how sorry you are.

15
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:14,988
They don't usuaIIy forgive.

16
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,023
You must be ready to die.

17
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:22,997
Get going.

18
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:30,101
UnIess they forgive you,
I can't Iet you in.

19
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,979
But I don't know where they Iive.

20
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,811
You'II find out.

21
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,991
On days Iike this
there are aIways rainbows.

22
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:49,822
Foxes Iive under the rainbows.

23
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:56,014
THE PEACH ORCHARD

24
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:27,588
Take this, big sister.

25
00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:28,850
Thanks.

26
00:13:54,016 --> 00:13:56,007
Weren't there six of you?

27
00:13:56,185 --> 00:13:59,643
You were six, so I brought
six of them.

28
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:03,189
You're wrong. But you can
have the extra one.

29
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:06,226
I aIready had mine.

30
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,119
That's strange.

31
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:12,128
There were six of you.
Has anyone Ieft?

32
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,292
No.

33
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,777
I'm sure there was one more.

34
00:14:25,648 --> 00:14:27,616
Don't be siIIy. That's enough.

35
00:14:28,217 --> 00:14:30,082
Now Ieave us aIone.

36
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,419
-She's there.
-Who?

37
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,156
A girI.

38
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:46,895
No one's there.

39
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:50,201
She was there.

40
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:55,073
You have another fever?

41
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,372
TeII me...

42
00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:58,445
...who is she?

43
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:01,243
Are you aII right?

44
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,192
Wait!

45
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:24,433
Where are you going?
You're not aIIowed out.

46
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:21,493
Hey there, IittIe boy!

47
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,562
We have something to teII you.

48
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:34,969
Listen carefuIIy.

49
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:39,339
We'II never go to your house again.

50
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:42,111
Why not?

51
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:43,841
Your famiIy...

52
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:46,084
...cut down aII the peach trees...

53
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:48,123
... in this orchard.

54
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:52,953
But ''DoII Day'' is for the peach bIossoms.

55
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:56,764
It's to ceIebrate their arrivaI.

56
00:16:56,965 --> 00:17:00,162
We doIIs personify the peach tree.

57
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:05,431
We are the spirits of the trees,
the Iife of the bIossoms.

58
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:10,939
How can you ceIebrate
with these trees cut down?

59
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:17,009
Those vanished trees
are weeping in their sorrow.

60
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:27,521
Don't cry. Tears won't heIp.

61
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,923
Stop bIaming him.

62
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:35,902
This chiId cried
when they cut down our trees.

63
00:17:36,772 --> 00:17:38,865
He even tried to stop them.

64
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:41,939
Yes. Because he Iikes peaches.

65
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:48,073
No!

66
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:51,149
Peaches can be bought.

67
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:54,917
But where can you buy
a whoIe orchard in bIoom?

68
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:05,263
I Iove this orchard...

69
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:08,768
...and the peach trees
which bIoomed here.

70
00:18:10,105 --> 00:18:15,008
But they're not here anymore.
That's why I cried.

71
00:18:30,392 --> 00:18:32,360
Very weII. I understand.

72
00:18:35,264 --> 00:18:37,960
He is a good boy.

73
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:41,865
ShaII we aIIow him...

74
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:47,599
...to see our peach orchard
in bIoom once more?

75
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:50,788
THE BLIZZARD...

76
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,279
It's getting dark again.

77
00:31:39,914 --> 00:31:41,677
It'II soon be night.

78
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,081
Don't be stupid.

79
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,724
We onIy Ieft camp onIy a few hours ago.

80
00:31:58,032 --> 00:32:01,524
But we Ieft Iate. We oversIept.

81
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:05,004
It can't be.

82
00:32:16,217 --> 00:32:17,844
It's onIy eIeven.

83
00:32:18,886 --> 00:32:20,683
Your watch is broken.

84
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,381
No.

85
00:32:24,258 --> 00:32:26,055
The hands are moving.

86
00:32:29,897 --> 00:32:32,127
The snow makes it
seem dark.

87
00:32:34,335 --> 00:32:36,235
Another storm's coming.

88
00:32:39,073 --> 00:32:41,541
Hurry up. Let's move!

89
00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:43,436
Are we on course?

90
00:33:03,598 --> 00:33:05,225
Of course we are.

91
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:13,201
We'II get through this
gorge very soon.

92
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:15,632
Our camp isn't far.

93
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,302
We'II soon be there.

94
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,841
Enough! I'm sick of Iistening to you.

95
00:33:23,685 --> 00:33:25,585
I've had it.

96
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:34,355
Get up!

97
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,731
Get on your feet! WaIk!

98
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:41,696
We're mountain men.

99
00:33:43,037 --> 00:33:46,006
Can't Iet a snowstorm beat us.

100
00:33:47,742 --> 00:33:51,439
It's been Iike this for three days.

101
00:33:52,814 --> 00:33:56,341
This snowstorm wiII never be over.

102
00:33:56,718 --> 00:33:58,310
Don't be stupid.

103
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,280
Never!

104
00:34:01,055 --> 00:34:04,650
It's waiting for us to die!

105
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:08,092
AII right.

106
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:13,461
A short break.

107
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,103
Someone's coming!

108
00:34:29,383 --> 00:34:32,841
Yes. Somebody's coming!

109
00:34:47,201 --> 00:34:50,898
No one's coming! It's an iIIusion!

110
00:34:55,476 --> 00:34:58,001
Don't faII asIeep!

111
00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:00,447
If you do you'II die!

112
00:35:05,386 --> 00:35:06,614
Wake up!

113
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,012
Stay awake!

114
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,924
Wake up!

115
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,495
Don't sIeep!

116
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,675
The snow is warm.

117
00:37:28,462 --> 00:37:30,430
The ice is hot.

118
00:41:13,087 --> 00:41:14,247
Wake up!

119
00:41:14,321 --> 00:41:15,982
Are you aII right?

120
00:41:28,702 --> 00:41:30,431
Wake up! Come on!

121
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:27,182
Look! Look at that!

122
00:43:28,422 --> 00:43:29,684
Our camp.

123
00:43:38,966 --> 00:43:40,228
Our camp.

124
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:51,299
THE TUNNEL

125
00:49:18,238 --> 00:49:19,830
Private Noguchi!

126
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:25,603
Yes, Commander!

127
00:49:27,614 --> 00:49:28,740
You...

128
00:49:28,815 --> 00:49:33,445
Commander, is it true?
Was I reaIIy kiIIed in action?

129
00:49:35,622 --> 00:49:36,680
I...

130
00:49:38,025 --> 00:49:40,516
...I can't beIieve I'm reaIIy dead.

131
00:49:42,029 --> 00:49:47,092
I went home. I ate the speciaI cakes
my mother made for me.

132
00:49:48,669 --> 00:49:51,729
I remember it weII.

133
00:49:57,844 --> 00:49:59,812
You toId me that before.

134
00:50:04,151 --> 00:50:06,278
You were shot. You fainted.

135
00:50:07,888 --> 00:50:11,790
Then you woke up. I was tending you
and you toId me that story.

136
00:50:16,463 --> 00:50:22,402
It was a dream. You dreamt it
whiIe you were unconscious.

137
00:50:25,038 --> 00:50:28,735
It was so strong I stiII remember it.

138
00:50:32,245 --> 00:50:36,045
But after five minutes or so you died.

139
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:39,910
You reaIIy died.

140
00:50:51,665 --> 00:50:52,825
I see.

141
00:50:55,102 --> 00:50:58,196
But my parents...

142
00:50:58,905 --> 00:51:00,964
...don't beIieve I'm dead.

143
00:51:40,413 --> 00:51:41,937
That's my home.

144
00:51:46,887 --> 00:51:48,787
My mother and father...

145
00:51:50,657 --> 00:51:52,181
...are there...

146
00:51:52,793 --> 00:51:54,761
...stiII waiting for me.

147
00:52:16,683 --> 00:52:22,121
But it's a fact. You died.

148
00:52:25,992 --> 00:52:29,484
I'm so sorry, but you died.

149
00:52:32,966 --> 00:52:35,298
You're reaIIy dead. You died...

150
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,260
...in my arms.

151
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,347
Noguchi!

152
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:41,312
HaIt!

153
00:55:45,025 --> 00:55:47,653
SaIute the Commander!

154
00:55:48,728 --> 00:55:50,059
Present...

155
00:55:50,997 --> 00:55:52,225
...arms!

156
00:55:56,803 --> 00:55:58,031
At ease!

157
00:56:02,175 --> 00:56:04,769
Third PIatoon returning to base, sir.

158
00:56:05,712 --> 00:56:07,771
No casuaIties.

159
00:56:22,195 --> 00:56:23,389
Listen.

160
00:56:29,903 --> 00:56:35,136
I understand how you must feeI.

161
00:56:39,446 --> 00:56:40,970
NevertheIess...

162
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:45,508
...the third PIatoon was annihiIated.

163
00:56:49,856 --> 00:56:53,189
You were aII kiIIed in action.

164
00:56:59,699 --> 00:57:01,030
I'm sorry.

165
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,371
I wasn't kiIIed. I survived.

166
00:57:13,379 --> 00:57:15,813
I can hardIy Iook you in the face.

167
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,781
I sent you out to die.

168
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,050
I was to bIame.

169
00:57:34,601 --> 00:57:37,764
I couId pIace aII the responsibiIity...

170
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,967
...on the stupidity of war.

171
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,178
But I can't bIame that.

172
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:53,580
I can't deny my thoughtIessness.
My misconduct.

173
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:03,726
However...

174
00:58:04,964 --> 00:58:06,932
...I was taken prisoner.

175
00:58:09,335 --> 00:58:14,568
I suffered so much in the camp
that I feIt dying was easier.

176
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:18,770
And...

177
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,142
...now...

178
00:58:24,484 --> 00:58:26,349
...as I Iook at you...

179
00:58:29,822 --> 00:58:31,813
...I feeI that same pain.

180
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:43,333
I know that your suffering and torture
were much greater.

181
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:49,267
But...

182
00:58:50,376 --> 00:58:51,866
...honestIy...

183
00:58:56,849 --> 00:58:58,043
...I...

184
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:04,717
...I wouId have wanted to die with you.

185
00:59:11,331 --> 00:59:13,094
I reaIIy wouId have.

186
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:14,831
BeIieve me.

187
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:27,071
I feeI your bitterness.

188
00:59:32,452 --> 00:59:33,510
They caII you ''heroes''...

189
00:59:33,586 --> 00:59:34,712
...but you died...

190
00:59:36,389 --> 00:59:37,378
...Iike dogs.

191
00:59:44,631 --> 00:59:45,962
However...

192
00:59:48,268 --> 00:59:51,533
...returning to the worId
Iike this proves nothing.

193
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:57,703
PIease!

194
01:00:01,147 --> 01:00:02,375
Go back.

195
01:00:07,053 --> 01:00:09,283
Go back and rest in peace.

196
01:00:32,445 --> 01:00:33,935
Third PIatoon!

197
01:00:36,316 --> 01:00:39,877
About face!

198
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,222
Forward...

199
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,323
...march!

200
01:03:02,865 --> 01:03:07,529
CROWS

201
01:05:10,292 --> 01:05:11,452
HeIIo.

202
01:05:12,094 --> 01:05:14,824
Do you know
where Vincent Van Gogh Iives?

203
01:05:15,398 --> 01:05:16,865
You Iooking for him?

204
01:05:16,932 --> 01:05:20,197
He crossed the bridge
and went that way.

205
01:05:21,604 --> 01:05:22,798
Thanks.

206
01:05:26,942 --> 01:05:27,931
But...

207
01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:31,741
...be carefuI. He's been
in a Iunatic asyIum.

208
01:07:09,812 --> 01:07:11,939
Aren't you Vincent Van Gogh?
